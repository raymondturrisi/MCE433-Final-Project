# MCE433-Final-Project
 Final project for my Mechatronics class. Here I was tasked to create a user interface which controlled functions on an arduino over serial communication. My user interface was created in Python's tkinter, where I used three pages: a home page which displayed a list of jobs and their current status, a page where a user would load jobs, and then a page which would plot the past 60 seconds of the current job. A job is defined by a desired temperature and time, but has other parameters such as current temperature and time remaining. Jobs are processed within a queue, which are automatically communicated with the arduino to perform several functions which can be seen in the appended powerpoint presentation.
